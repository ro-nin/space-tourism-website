## My process
This project was bootstrapped with create-next-app@latest with tailwind, using the Next V13 "app" directory workflow and the React client/server components. Dynamic routes were forced in the project for exercise purpose and the solution ended up being halfway dynamic (since the "category" or first level sections are static) but the date of the categories (ex: the "sections") can be extended by adding content in the JSON, handled by the dynamic routes (ex: /category/\[section]).

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Continued development

- Migrate to purely static website (no dynamic routes)
- Remove Css Classes

### Known issues

- Layout shifts
